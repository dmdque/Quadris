Quadris
=======

Modified version of Tetris (called Quadris) for a University group programming project with Thao Nguyen in Spring 2013.

To play, run:
> make

> ./quadris

To play, type in one of the following commands in the command line interface:

> left, right, down, clockwise, counterclockwise, drop, levelup, leveldown, restart

`levelup` and `leveldown` increase and decrease the difficulty, respectivel.

Any unique prefix of a command can be used as a shortcut for that command. eg. `ri` will behave idendically to `right`.
